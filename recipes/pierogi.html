        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create the sauerkrat filling by using a skillet on medium heat, melt butter, mixing in onions. Cook until onions are translucent, then add sauerkraut, and cook for five more minutes. Use salt and pepper for seasoning, and transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>With the same skillet & temperature, melt butter, adding in onions to make the potato filling. Cook and stir until onions are translucent, then add mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Then, remove skillet from heat.</li>
            <li>Make the dough by beating sour cream and eggs together inside of a large bowl. Beat until smooth. In a separate bowl, place flour, baking powder, and salt, then stir from the sour cream mixture until dough forms. Spinkle flour on a surface, and knead dough until smooth.</li>
            <li>Apportion dough in half, and use one half to create a roll approximately 1/8 inchs thick. In the center of each round, add in a small amount of potato filling. Use water to moisturize edges, before folding them over, and sealing with a fork. With the remaining half, roll and fill with sauerkraut filling.</li>
            <li>Boil a large, lightly salted, pot of water. Then, add a few pierogies at a time to the pot, and cook until they reach the top. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove, add to plate to cool, and serve.</li>
